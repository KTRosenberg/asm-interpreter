The assembly-like language interpreter have 8 instructions:
	1)mov
	2)cmp
	3)je
	4)jmp
	5)print
	6)call
	7)ret
	8)halt

And 52 registers:
	a-z A-Z

For example:
	mov x,1  	means move 1 to x
	mov x,x+y 	means move the sum of x+y to x
	print "hello,world"	prints string hello,world
	call func1	call a new function func1

To use:
	1)program the assembly-like language in a file, test.s for example.
	2)run the program by type the following commmand in terminal
		./interpreter test.s
	3)voil√†, that's it!

The purpose of assembly-like language interpreter:
	1)tool to learn assembly language programming for newbies
	2)have fun programming anywhere by cross-compile it to Android phones

NOTE:
	This interpreter doesn't support floating-point arithmetics such as "mov x,3.14", or code comment.
	Be ware!
